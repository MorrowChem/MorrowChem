I use Machine Learning 🤖 to learn from Quantum Mechanics 𝜳 and simulate amorphous materials 🕹️  

Find me [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZXZAa8oAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) on Google Scholar!  

I wrote and maintain the following repositories:  

❓ how-to-validate-potentials - some tutorial-style examples for validating machine-learned interatomic potentials  
💍 julia_rings - a fast algorithm for figuring out the ring structure of big boxes of materials (10<sup>6+</sup> atoms!)
